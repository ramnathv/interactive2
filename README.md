Interactive Documents with R
=============================

This is a demo interactive document that uses Slidify, rCharts, AngularJS and OpenCPU. There are four interactive components in this document

1. An interactive app using OpenCPU + AngularJS.
2. An interactive console again using OpenCPU.
3. An interactive chart using rCharts.
4. An interactive quiz using javascript widgets.

I will update this repo with the Rmd file and steps required to create this document. If you want to learn more, consider attending my [tutorial on Interactive Documents with R at UseR2014](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/).
